## Our Commitment to Safety

The personal safety, health and well-being of every employee at In-Ex Plastering and Stucco Inc. is one of our most important responsibilities. We believe that good safety performance is a leading indicator of a well-managed, efficient and profitable operation. In-Ex Plastering and Stucco Inc. will ensure that all workers have a safe and healthy work environment as is their right under the Manitoba Workplace Safety and Health Act and Regulations. Safety is a condition of employment with our company and shall not ever be sacrificed for the sake of expediency.

In-Ex Plastering and Stucco Inc. is proud to have achieved our COR certification with The Construction Safety Association of Manitoba (CSAM) in December of 2014. Our COR number is 81711-14. The Certificate of Recognition (COR) Program is the ultimate accreditation to verify companies that have implemented a comprehensive health and safety program. This program provides industry employers with an effective safety and health management system to reduce incidents and injuries along with associated human and financial costs.

COR is nationally trademarked and endorsed by participating members of the Canadian Federation of Construction Safety Associations (CFCSA). To achieve national safety program accreditation, CSAM practices the utmost diligence to ensure COR standards are upheld. Public and private project owners frequently use COR as a pre-qualifier or a condition of contract across Canada because the program is recognized and endorsed by the regulatory agencies of the Government.

The COR program is officially recognized and endorsed by:

* Manitoba Labour;
* Workplace Safety and Health (WSH);
* Workers Compensation Board of Manitoba (WCB);
* SAFE Work Manitoba.

In-Ex Plastering and Stucco Inc. has been working with Serenity Safety Consulting Inc. for the over four years. Serenity Safety Consulting Inc. is our primary resource for workplace health and safety compliance, training, and the annual COR audit.
